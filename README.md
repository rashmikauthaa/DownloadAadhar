🤖 **Automating Aadhaar Card Retrieval: A UiPath Success Story** 🌐

I'm excited to share a glimpse of my latest automation project! Using UiPath, I've successfully automated the process of retrieving Aadhaar cards from the official portal. This video demonstrates how I integrated OCR technology to solve CAPTCHA challenges, enabling seamless OTP retrieval and automated download of Aadhaar cards.

🔧 **Key Highlights:**
- **Automated CAPTCHA Solving:** See how OCR technology accurately handles CAPTCHA challenges.
- **OTP Retrieval:** Witness the automated process of obtaining OTPs for secure Aadhaar card access.
- **Download Automation:** Learn how UiPath smoothly downloads Aadhaar cards once the process is verified.

🚀 This project not only saves time but also ensures accuracy and reliability in handling sensitive information. I'm excited to share my journey in leveraging RPA to simplify complex workflows.

🎥 Watch the video to see UiPath in action, transforming how we interact with government portals and enhancing efficiency in digital services.
